## Summary

In week 0 of the bootcamp, we were introduced to a Business scenario and a good idea as to how it works in real life companies. We were also made aware of the "Iron triangle" and how it works according to the requirement of the company. A "Good Architecture" must be thorough about its RRACs which is Requirements, Risks, Assumptions and Constraints. We were also introduced to C4 model and TOGAF model which is for visualizing the software architecture. We were given a brief on requirement gathering and how it is important to "Devlop a common dictionary", ask "dumb questions", "pretend to be the ned user" and make sure to "document everything". Design types were also covered
* Conceptual Design : understanding and requirement gathering of the work. *Intial idea
* Logical Design : Functional blocks of conceptual design. *Blueprint
* Physical Design : Actual Design of logical design. *Implementation
